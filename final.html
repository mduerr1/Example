	<h3>Number 10: Antti Raanta (Arizona)</h3>

		Although Antti Raanta is a young and somewhat inexperienced goalie, 
		he had an excelent season. Especially considering the fact that 
		he played for one of the worst teams in the league. 
		In addition to making some spectacular saves, he also managed 
		to steal 3 shutouts and boasts a 2.24 GAA, 
		tied for second best in the league.

		<img class="left" src="http://sportsmockery.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Jonathan-Quick-Throws-a-temper-tantrum-photo-USAToday.jpg"/>
		Consistantly the most flexible goaltender in the NHL, Quick had 
		yet another impressive season with a team that did not have 
		the stongest of offenses. The Kings led the league in lowest 
		goals against, thanks in large part to their William M. Jennings 
		award winning goaltender.

		Currently the only two-time Vezina award winner active in the 
		NHL, Sergei Bobrovsky continues to accumulate wins in the toughest 
		division in hockey. Starting in a total of 65 games this season,
		he was able to handle one of the heavier workloads amongst all goalies.

		This year Andersen and the Maple Leafs broke and set new 
		franchise records for most wins and points in a season. 
		Although sometimes inconsistent, when he is on his game, 
		Andersen is nearly imposible to beat.

		Although he had a bit of an off year, Braden Holtby has had the 
		best postseason of his career. He led his team to the Stanley 
		Cup Final for the first time since 1999. His ability to move 
		laterally is among his best attributes. Holtby showcased his 
		talents in the Eastern Conference Final where he shutout the 
		Lightning for the last two and a half games.

		Rebounding from a rough start, Rask had a stretch of two and 
		half months without a regulation loss. His excelent rebound 
		control and composed self are amongst the reasons why he is
		in such elite company.

		One of the largest goalies in the league at 6'4", Hellebuyck 
		emerged this year as a top five net-minder. He led his team 
		to their first playoff series win and to the Western Conference 
		final. He also set franchise records in wins and save percentage. 
		Additionally, he is a finalist for the Vezina trophy, the 
		award for the best goaltender throughout the regular season.

		Finally earning the role of starter, the 23-year-old uses his 
		size and flexibility to make sound, but uniquely creative saves. 
		Vasilevskiy set franchise records for wins and shutouts while 
		he led the lightning to the Eastern Conference Final and stood 
		on his head to keep his team in the series. Deservedly so, he 
		has also been nominateded for the Vezina trophy.

		After being taken by Vegas in the expansion draft Fluery has 
		had yet another career year. Although he suffered from injury 
		early in the season he was able to return and lead the Knights 
		to first place in the Pacific Division. Additionally, he has 
		transended to a new level of goaltending throughout these 
		playoffs. Currently with an unheard of GAA and save percentage, 
		Fluery is on track to win his third consecutive Stanley Cup.
		If he does so, he would most certainly win the Conn Smythe 
		Trophy as the playoff MVP.

		With his ability to cover the lower half of the net as well as 
		his strong skating, Pekka Rinne was simply sensational for much 
		of the past season. In a 23 game span, the Finn went 21-1-1, 
		ultimately leading to career highs in wins and shutouts. He also 
		finished the season as a Vezina finalist and President's
